# JavaDataMining

### What is it? ###
**A Java data mining API.** A simple compilation of libraries in java with some extra Data Processing code I made trying to make a simple API for these libraries:

[Apache POI](https://poi.apache.org/) Currently version 3.13
[Java-ML](http://java-ml.sourceforge.net/) Currently version 0.1.7

(Mainly .xls and .data file management code).

### What is it not? ###
JavaDataMining (JDM) is not a GUI Program, not even a program on its own.

### Can I contribute? ###
Sure! There is still a lot to do and anybody willing to contribute is welcome


### How do I compile the code on my machine? ###

- **Temporary (Until i build the project correctly):**

-Download (or clone) the repository.

-Create a new Java Project on eclipse.

-Copy the downloaded src folder to your eclipse project home directory.

-Compile using eclipse (If you got here, you know how this is done)
