# JavaDataMining

Unfortunately, this project is not in development any more. I am trying to develop other "bigger" projects that take almost all my time. I will release bug fix patches if someone finds any bug, but there will be no more improvements, unless the need for JDM changes, a lot. 

### What is it? ###
**A Java data mining API.** 
A simple compilation of libraries in java with some extra Data Processing code I made trying to make a simple API for these libraries:

[Apache POI](https://poi.apache.org/) Currently version 3.13

[Java-ML](http://java-ml.sourceforge.net/) Currently version 0.1.7

(Mainly .xls and .data file management code).

### What is it not? ###
JavaDataMining (JDM) is not a GUI Program, not even a program on its own.

### Version Control ###

This project uses Semantic Versioning. Version format is X.Y.Z:

- **X:** New program version.

- **Y:** New feature or huge bug fix patch.

- **Z:** Minor fix or patch.

**While the project is in version 0.Y.Z, new versions might not be (and most likely wonÂ´t be) backwards-compatible.**

### Can I contribute? ###
Sure! There is still a lot to do and anybody willing to contribute is welcome



### How do I compile the project? ###

- Download the source code.
- Import to Eclipse workspace (Netbeans or any other should work fine too)
- Add missing libraries:
   - Javaml-0.1.7.jar
   - poi-3.13-20150929.jar
   - poi-ooxml-3.13-20150929.jar
